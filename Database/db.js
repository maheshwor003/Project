          detail1: "Gosaikunda is a famous name for the purest holy lake. It is situated in Rasuwa district of Nepal covering a surface with about 13.8 ha (34 acres). It lies, north from Kathmandu between Helambu, Langtang Valley, and Langtang National Park. The measurement shows that it is 43 (kilometers) far from Kathmandu city. It stands steadily 4,380 meters high from the sea level. This is also well- known for the sacred lake in Nepalese society because of a historical belief that connects the lake to Lord Shiva, the god of power and destruction in Hindu mythology. As this sacred lake is constantly spreading its divine blessing to the people. Most of the people believe that Lord Shiva, who meditate for several years in a Himalaya of Nepal and Tibet, took a bath in this lake for acquiring purity of soul. So people of Hindu religion follow the same rituals to purify their souls through various sins. Especially on the full moon day of August falls in the month of Shrawan, people of Nepal celebrate the Janai-                 Purnima (a very famous festival of Nepal) and on that day there at Gosaikunda seems filled with devotees. On this very special day there attends a religious mela (Nepali Carnival) by Hindus and do celebrate with Buddhist community as well. This day pilgrim whoever congregates this mela changes their Janais- the sacred thread worn around the body or on the wrist by the Hindu Brahmins but before all the devotees take bath and pray to homage to Lord Shiva. This means their sin, sorrow, and pain are assumed to wash off by the pure water of this lake",
